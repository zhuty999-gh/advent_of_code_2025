## Days

| Day | Puzzle | Key Technique |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Secret Entrance | Parsing, basic logic |
| 2 | Gift Shop | Simulation |
| 3 | Lobby | String processing |
| 4 | Printing Department | Topological sort, dependency resolution |
| 5 | Cafeteria | Recursion, range merging |
| 6 | Trash Compactor | Ray casting, point-in-polygon |
| 7 | Laboratories | Search, optimization |
| 8 | Playground | Grid traversal |
| 9 | Movie Theater | Constraint satisfaction |
| 10 | Factory | Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) |
| 11 | Reactor | Topological sort + DP on DAG for path counting |
| 12 | Christmas Tree Farm | Bitmask backtracking for 2D shape packing (NP-complete) |

## Structure

Each day has its own directory with the puzzle prompt, input, example, and solution code (Python).

A `learning.md` file captures key algorithms and techniques learned along the way: prime factorization, ray casting, MILP, DP on DAGs, bitmask backtracking, Dancing Links, and more.
